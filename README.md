JavaScript by Brandon Rowe

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance the interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I made the form more user-friendly by:

1. adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
2. validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

I am going for a grade of "exceeds expectations." As a result I programmed:

1. to hide the "Color" label and select menu until a T-Shirt design is selected from the "Design" menu.
2. to display error messages related to all credit card input fields so that more information is provided depending on the error. For example, if the user hasn’t entered a credit card number and the field is completely blank, the error message reads “Please enter a credit card number.” If the field isn’t empty but contains only 10 numbers, the error message reads “Please enter a number that is between 13 and 16 digits long.”
3. to provide real-time validation error messages for the name and email input fields. For example, if the user enters an invalid email address, the error appears as the user begins to type, and disappears as soon as the user has entered a complete and correctly formatted email address.

Thanks in advance for your time and expertise. :-)
